To answer this question, I used the same metrics that I did for 'Best_Hospitals.txt' and 'Best_States.txt'. In order to determine the answer to this question, I took the table the I created that contained all of the procedures for both initial treatment and readmissions (AllProcedures) and took the variance of the scores of each measure name, grouping by measures name. Once I found the variance for each procedure, I ranked from highest variance to lowest variance.
